# webrtc-tutorial-demo

Sample WebRTC GetuserMedia and PeerConnection code in a demoable format.  Two PeerConnections are in one page to mimic two browsers.  Normally this would be over two browsers with possibley a server component to relay the WebRTC messages.   I do all this in one web app to make this easier to demo.

This demo is a series of steps which builds up both the HTML and JavaScript for a WebRTC Audio and Video PeerConnection demo.
